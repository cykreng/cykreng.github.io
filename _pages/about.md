Bienvenidos! My name is Cynthia, a Taiwanese girl who have been spending the last 10 years in the US spread across Michigan, Texas, and California. I love ice cream, hikes with water falls, puzzles, and any activity that makes my heart race. I have an engineering background but have always been more interested in the people aspect and how decisions are made. As of 2022, I have moved to Barcelona to start my MBA with hopes to start my own company in the near future. 

I believe food is the universal language that is shared across all countries and cultures. I love seeing the world through trying different cuisines. Recently I have learned that a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions come from food waste. I want to combine my passion in food and technology to create a solution that can tackle this problem. If you have thoughts or comments about this, please reach me at [krengc@outlook.com](mailto:krengc@outlook.com).

I will be using this blog to document my journey growing towards an entrepreneur with my MBA life, restaurant exploration, and everything else in between.
