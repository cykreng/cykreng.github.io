Bienvenidos! My name is Cynthia, a Taiwanese girl who have been spending the last 10 years in the US spread across Michigan, Texas, and California. I love ice cream, hikes with water falls, puzzles, and any activity that makes my heart race. I have an engineering background but have always been more interested in people and how decisions are made. I had the luxury to spend 2022-2024 in Barcelona pursuing my MBA, moved back to the Bay Area after, and now off to another new destination.

I believe food is the universal language that is shared across all countries and cultures. I love seeing the world through trying different cuisines. Having lived in three different countries that have such varying relationships with the local food, I've now gotten more interested in places where technology can be a driving force to food system changes. [Producycle](https://producycle.com/) is the latest iteration of what this looks like. There still so much to learn, but if there's anything you'd like to share or discuss about institutional procurement, feel free to reach me at [cynthia@producycle.com](mailto:cynthia@producycle.com).

I will be using this blog to document my journey growing growing as a person now post MBA, restaurant exploration, and everything else in between.
